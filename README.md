# Improving Pseudo-Time Stepping Convergence for CFD Simulations With Neural Networks

This repository contains the training data for the paper

> Zandbergen, Anouk, Tycho van Noorden, and Alexander Heinlein. "Improving Pseudo-Time Stepping Convergence for CFD Simulations With Neural Networks." arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.06717 (2023).

The data on which the neural network can be found under `training_data-total.csv`

For each column in Table 3, please open the corresponding back-step geometry map.  In each map you will find a .csv file starting with the name of the geometry, followed by the last three numbers of the maximum element size in Table 3.
